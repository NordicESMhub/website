#            Galaxy Europe will continue to operate over the holiday season although with reduced support capacity. This period will run from 24th December 2021 until the 4th of January 2022.
#            During this time:
#            - No new tools or reference data will be installed
#            - No requests for disk space will be completed
#            - No support tickets will be responded to
#            - No TIaaS requests will be evaluated
#

#           Tomorrow, February 25th, we need to perform urgent maintenance to our main storage. We don't expect a major issue except for 
#           jobs that need to access data older than 10 weeks ago. For these, it's possible to get a "no data" answer or a timeout. 
#           Everything should return to normal operation by the end of the day. 
#           
#           Sorry for the inconvenience.

            On March 1st, bwCloud will undergo a scheduled maintenance, and we have to shut down most of our computing resources.
            We will keep the web server running, accepting jobs and workflows, but there will be a delay in processing them.
            The running jobs, at that date, will be interrupted and rescheduled for a new start (from scratch, no intermediate results can be saved) 
            as soon as the cloud is available again.
            Please take it into account in your job schedule.
            
            Sorry for the inconvenience.
